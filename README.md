# Secure Reactive CI/CD with Kubernetes (Local-First)

This repository contains a **local-first, secure, reactive CI/CD system for Kubernetes**, developed as part of a university internship project.

The project demonstrates **DevSecOps practices**, **policy-as-code**, and **µs-inspired reactive Infrastructure-as-Code**, without using external registries or cloud services.

> The project is intentionally **frozen at the end of Phase 1 (Step 3)** for academic evaluation.

## Objectives (Phase 1)

- Containerize and deploy a microservice to Kubernetes
- Build a secure CI pipeline (local-safe mode)
- Integrate automated security checks (DevSecOps)
- Apply reactive IaC concepts (µs-inspired)
- Enforce policy-based deployments
- Ensure full local reproducibility

---

## Technologies

- Docker (local image only)
- Kubernetes (kind)
- GitHub Actions (CI)
- Trivy (security scanning)
- kube-linter / kube-score (manifest analysis)
- Policy-as-code (OPA-style)
- µs-inspired reactive logic
